@Chapter File Formats

The following file formats are introduced by the HyperCells package:
- **HyperCell cell graph** (`*.hcc`) for storing the cell graphs, i.e., `TGCellGraph`
   objects (see <Ref Sect='Section_TGCellGraph'/>)
- **HyperCell model graph** (`*.hcm`) for storing the model graphs, i.e.,
   `TGCellModelGraph` objects (see <Ref Sect='Section_TGCellModelGraph'/>)
- **HyperCell supercell graph** (`*.hcs`) for storing the supercell model graphs, i.e.,
   `TGSuperCellModelGraph` objects (see <Ref Sect='Section_TGSuperCellModelGraph'/>)

These file formats are described in detail below.

@Section HyperCell cell graph (*.hcc)
@SectionLabel FileFormatTGCellGraph

The basic file structure of a HyperCell cell graph file is as follows (with placeholders
marked by `&lt;...&gt;`):

@BeginLogSession
HyperCells HCC version 1.0
[ <r>, <q>, <p> ]
[ <relators> , <center> ]
[ g1, g2, ... ] -> <generators>
<TDGAMMA>
[ <TGGx>, <TGGy>, <TGGz> ]
<vertices>
<edges>
<edge translations>
<faces>
<boundary>
@EndLogSession

The first line specifies the file format and its version.

The second line gives the signature $(r,q,p)$ of the underlying triangle group
$\Delta(r,q,p)$ and the third line specifies the triangle-group quotient
$\Delta^+(r,q,p)/\Gamma$ by the list of relators `&lt;relators&gt;` given as elements of
the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ with generators $x$, $y$, $z$ and the center
of the cell given as the integer `&lt;center&gt;` with `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the
center lying at the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$ of the fundamental Schwarz triangle,
respectively.

The fourth line specifies the generators of the translation group $\Gamma$. To the left
of `-&gt;` are the generators of the finitely presented group and to the right the list
`&lt;generators&gt;` of their images in the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ in terms
of the generators $x$, $y$, $z$.

The fifth line gives the transversal $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma)$ as a list `&lt;TDGAMMA&gt;`
of elements of the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ and the sixth line specifies the
transversals $T_{G^+}(G_w^+)$ as lists `&lt;TGGw&gt;` with $w=x,y,z$ (`w=x,y,z`) of
preimages of elements of the quotient group $G^+\cong\Delta^+/\Gamma$ under the quotient
homomorphism $\Delta^+\to G^+$, i.e., in terms of the generators $x$, $y$, $z$.

Lines seven to ten specify the vertices, edges, edge translations and faces of the cell:
- The vertices are given as a list `&lt;vertices&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ w, gi ]`, where `w` is `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$
  of the fundamental Schwarz triangle and `gi` is the position of the element in
  the transversal $T_{G^+}(G_w^+)$.
- The edges are given as a list `&lt;edges&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ v1, v2, s ]`, where `v1` and `v2` are the positions of the vertices
  in `&lt;vertices&gt;` connected by the edge, `s` is the position of the element in
  $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma)$ labeling the Schwarz triangle this edge is a part of.
- The edge translations, i.e., the translations relating the unit cell containing
  the first vertex (`v1`) to the unit cell containing the second (`v2`) are given
  as a list `&lt;edge translations&gt;` of elements of the finitely presented group,
  i.e., in terms of the generators given to the left of `-&gt;` in the third line.
  If `v1` corresponds to the vertex $(w, [g_{u_w}]_w)$ and `v2` to the vertex
  $(w', [g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}}]_{w'})$, then `gam` corresponds to the translation
  $\gamma$ such that
  $$g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}} = g_{u_w}\gamma.$$
- The faces are given as a list `&lt;faces&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ edge, orientation ]`, where `edge` is the position of the edge in `&lt;edges&gt;`
  and `orientation` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether the edge is traversed in
  the same or opposite direction as the edge given in `&lt;edges&gt;`.

Finally, the eleventh line specifies the boundary identifications of the cell as a list
`&lt;boundary&gt;` with entries of the form `[ d1, d2, e, b, m, gam ]`, where `d1`,
`d2` are elements of $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma)\subset\Delta^+$ labeling the Schwarz
triangles this edge is a part of, `e` the position in `&lt;edges&gt;`, `b` a running
integer index of the boundary (identical for identified boundaries), `m` either `0`
or `1` indicating the orientation of the triangle associated with this instance of
the boundary (0 for gray and 1 for white Schwarz triangle), and `gam` the translation
relating the given to the identified boundary, as an element of the finitely presented
group, i.e., in terms of the generators given to the left of `-&gt;` in the third line.

The full file structure of a HyperCell cell graph file thus is as follows:

The first line specifies the file format and its version.

The second line gives the signature $(r,q,p)$ of the underlying triangle group
$\Delta(r,q,p)$ and the third line specifies the triangle-group quotient
$\Delta^+(r,q,p)/\Gamma$ by the list of relators `&lt;relators&gt;` given as elements of
the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ with generators $x$, $y$, $z$ and the center
of the cell given as the integer `&lt;center&gt;` with `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the
center lying at the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$ of the fundamental Schwarz triangle,
respectively.

The fourth line specifies the generators of the translation group $\Gamma$. To the left
of `-&gt;` are the generators of the finitely presented group and to the right the list
`&lt;generators&gt;` of their images in the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ in terms
of the generators $x$, $y$, $z$.

The fifth line gives the transversal $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma)$ as a list `&lt;TDGAMMA&gt;`
of elements of the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ and the sixth line specifies the

preimages of elements of the quotient group $G^+\cong\Delta^+/\Gamma$ under the quotient
homomorphism $\Delta^+\to G^+$, i.e., in terms of the generators $x$, $y$, $z$.

The seventh line specifies the model type.
The following model types are currently implemented:
- **Derived graph**: general model graph with vertices, edges, and faces derived from
  the cell graph. The model type is given as `[ "VEF", [ vfs, efs, ffs ] ]`,
  where `vfs`, `efs`, and `ffs` are lists of integers between 1 and 3
  indicating the vertex types, edge types, and face types, respectively.
  See <Ref Func='TGCellModelGraph'/> for details.
- **Tessellation graph**: tessellation model graph derived from a cell graph of a triangle
  group. The model type is given as
  `[ "TESS", [ p, q ], [ "VEF", [ [ 2 ], [ 1 ], [ 3 ] ] ] ]` for the $\{p,q\}$
  tessellation and as `[ "TESS", [ p, q ], [ "VEF", [ [ 3 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ] ] ] ]`
  for the (dual) $\{q,p\}$ tessellation.
  See <Ref Func='TessellationModelGraph'/> for details.
- **Kagome graph**: kagome model graph derived from a cell graph of a triangle
  group. The model type is given as
  `[ "KAGOME", p, [ "VEF", [ [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 2, 3 ] ] ] ]`.
  See <Ref Func='KagomeModelGraph'/> for details.

Lines eight to eleven specify the vertices, edges, edge translations and faces of the cell:
- The vertices are given as a list `&lt;vertices&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ w, gi ]`, where `w` is `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$
  of the fundamental Schwarz triangle and `gi` is the position of the element in
  the transversal $T_{G^+}(G_w^+)$.
- The edges are given as a list `&lt;edges&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ v1, v2, tag ]`, where `v1` and `v2` are the positions of the vertices
  in `&lt;vertices&gt;` connected by the edge, and `tag` is a unique identifier
  of the edge.
  More details on the tags are given in the methods for constructing different
  models, see <Ref Sect='Section_ConstructingModels'/>.
- The edge translations, i.e., the translations relating the unit cell containing
  the first vertex (`v1`) to the unit cell containing the second (`v2`) are given
  as a list `&lt;edge translations&gt;` of elements of the finitely presented group,
  i.e., in terms of the generators given to the left of `-&gt;` in the third line.
  If `v1` corresponds to the vertex $(w, [g_{u_w}]_w)$ and `v2` to the vertex
  $(w', [g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}}]_{w'})$, then `gam` corresponds to the translation
  $\gamma$ such that
  $$g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}} = g_{u_w}\gamma.$$
- The faces are given as a list `&lt;faces&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ edge, orientation ]`, where `edge` is the position of the edge in `&lt;edges&gt;`
  and `orientation` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether the edge is traversed in
  the same or opposite direction as the edge given in `&lt;edges&gt;`.

The first line specifies the file format and its version.

The second line gives the signature $(r,q,p)$ of the underlying triangle group
$\Delta(r,q,p)$ and the third line specifies the triangle-group quotient
$\Delta^+(r,q,p)/\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}$ and $\Delta^+(r,q,p)/\Gamma_\mathrm{sc}$ by
the list of relators `&lt;primitive cell relators&gt;` and
`&lt;supercell relators&gt;`, respectively, given as elements of the proper triangle
group $\Delta^+$ with generators $x$, $y$, $z$ and the center of the cell given
as the integer `&lt;center&gt;` with `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the center
lying at the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$ of the fundamental Schwarz triangle, respectively.

The fourth line specifies the generators of the translation group $\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}$
of the primitive cell. To the left of `-&gt;` are the generators of the finitely
presented group and to the right the list `&lt;generators&gt;` of their images in
the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ in terms of the generators $x$, $y$, $z$.

The fifth line gives the transversal $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma_\mathrm{pc})$ as a list
`&lt;TDGAMMApc&gt;` of elements of the proper triangle group $\Delta^+$ and the
sixth line specifies the transversals $T_{G^+_\mathrm{pc}}(G_w^+)$ as lists
`&lt;TGpcGw&gt;` with $w=x,y,z$ (`w=x,y,z`) of preimages of elements of the quotient
group $G^+_\mathrm{pc}\cong\Delta^+/\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}$ under the quotient
homomorphism $\Delta^+\to G^+_\mathrm{pc}$, i.e., in terms of the generators $x$,
$y$, $z$.

Lines seven, ten, and eleven give the same information as lines three, four, and five,
respectively, but for the supercell ($G^+_\mathrm{sc}$, $\Gamma_\mathrm{sc}$)
instead of the primitive cell.
The eighth line specifies the homomorphism embedding the normal subgroup
$\Gamma_\mathrm{sc}$ in $\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}$ with the generators of the finitely
presented group $\Gamma_\mathrm{sc}$ to the left of `-&gt;` and their images in
the finitely presented group $\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}$ to the right.
The ninth line gives the corresponding transversal $T_{\Gamma_\mathrm{pc}}
(\Gamma_\mathrm{sc})$ as a list `&lt;TGAMMApcGAMMAsc&gt;` of elements of the
triangle group $\Delta^+$.

The twelfth line specifies the model type.
The following model types are currently implemented:
- **Derived graph**: general model graph with vertices, edges, and faces derived from
  the cell graph. The model type is given as `[ "VEF", [ vfs, efs, ffs ] ]`,
  where `vfs`, `efs`, and `ffs` are lists of integers between 1 and 3
  indicating the vertex types, edge types, and face types, respectively.
  See <Ref Func='TGCellModelGraph'/> for details.
- **Tessellation graph**: tessellation model graph derived from a cell graph of a triangle
  group. The model type is given as
  `[ "TESS", [ p, q ], [ "VEF", [ [ 2 ], [ 1 ], [ 3 ] ] ] ]` for the $\{p,q\}$
  tessellation and as `[ "TESS", [ p, q ], [ "VEF", [ [ 3 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ] ] ] ]`
  for the (dual) $\{q,p\}$ tessellation.
  See <Ref Func='TessellationModelGraph'/> for details.
- **Kagome graph**: kagome model graph derived from a cell graph of a triangle
  group. The model type is given as
  `[ "KAGOME", p, [ "VEF", [ [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 2, 3 ] ] ] ]`.
  See <Ref Func='KagomeModelGraph'/> for details.

Lines thirteen to sixteen specify the vertices, edges, edge translations and faces of the cell:
- The vertices are given as a list `&lt;vertices&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ w, gi ]`, where `w` is `1`, `2`, `3` corresponding to the vertex $x$, $y$, $z$
  of the fundamental Schwarz triangle and `gi` is the position of the element in
  the transversal $T_{G^+}(G_w^+)$.
- The edges are given as a list `&lt;edges&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ v1, v2, tag ]`, where `v1` and `v2` are the positions of the vertices
  in `&lt;vertices&gt;` connected by the edge, and `tag` is a unique identifier
  of the edge.
  The tag `tag` is of the form `[ v1pc, v2pc, tagpc ]` with `v1pc`, `v2pc` the
  positions of the vertices in the primitive cell, and `tagpc` the tag of the
  edge in the primitive cell (see <Ref Sect='Section_ConstructingModels'/>).
  Thus, `tag` specifies (up to the translation) the edge in the primitive cell.
- The edge translations, i.e., the translations relating the unit cell containing
  the first vertex (`v1`) to the unit cell containing the second (`v2`) are given
  as a list `&lt;edge translations&gt;` of elements of the finitely presented group,
  i.e., in terms of the generators given to the left of `-&gt;` in the third line.
  If `v1` corresponds to the vertex $(w, [g_{u_w}]_w)$ and `v2` to the vertex
  $(w', [g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}}]_{w'})$, then `gam` corresponds to the translation
  $\gamma$ such that
  $$g_{\tilde{u}_{w'}} = g_{u_w}\gamma.$$
- The faces are given as a list `&lt;faces&gt;` with entries of the form
  `[ edge, orientation ]`, where `edge` is the position of the edge in `&lt;edges&gt;`
  and `orientation` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether the edge is traversed in
  the same or opposite direction as the edge given in `&lt;edges&gt;`.

@Section HyperCells extensions
@SectionLabel FileFormatHyperCellsExtensions

In addition, the following file formats are introduced by the HyperCells package:
- **HyperCell adjacency matrix** (`*.hcqs`) for storing the adjacency matrices, i.e.,
   `TGQuotientSequencesAdjacencyMatrix` objects (see <Ref Sect='Section_TGQuotientSequencesAdjacencyMatrix'/>)

This file format is described in detail below.


@Subsection HyperCell adjacency matrix (*.hcqs)
@SubsectionLabel FileFormatTGQuotientSequencesAdjacencyMatrix

The basic file structure of a HyperCell adjacency matrix file is as follows
(with placeholders marked by `&lt;...&gt;`):

@BeginLogSession
HyperCells HCQS version 1.0
[ <r>, <q>, <p> ]
<boundByGenus>
<quotients>
<mirror symmetries>
<sparse>
<adjacency matrix>
@EndLogSession

The first line specifies the file format and its version. The second line specifies the upper bound 
for triangle group quotients with genus smaller than `&lt;boundByGenus&gt;`, and the third line, `&lt;quotients&gt;`, 
the corresponding list of triangle group quotients considered.

Line four, `&lt;mirror symmetries&gt;`, specifies
an ordered binary list of ones and zeros, 1 if quotients in `&lt;quotients&gt;` have mirror symmetries 0 otherwise.

The fifth line `&lt;sparse&gt;` specifies if line six, the adjacency matrix `&lt;adjacency matrix&gt;`, is sparsly
represented `true`, or dense `false`.

The full file structure of a HyperCell adjacency matrix file thus is as follows:

@BeginLogSession
HyperCells HCQS version 1.0
[ <r>, <q>, <p> ]
<boundByGenus>
[ [ <genus1>, <number1> ], [ <genus2>, <number2> ], ... ]
[ b1, b2, ... ]
<sparse>
[ entry1, entry2, ... ]
