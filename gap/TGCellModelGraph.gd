#! @Section Cell Model Graphs
#! @SectionLabel TGCellModelGraph
#! 
#! Tight-binding models are defined on top of a cell graph by selecting some of the
#! vertices of the cell graph and adding edges between them.
#! The model is thus defined on a **cell** and forms itself a graph of the same structure
#! as the cell graph. The vertices of the model graph are a subset of vertices of
#! the cell graph, while the edges must not be a subset of the edges of the cell graph.
#! Faces are given as ordered lists of edges of the model graph.
#!
#! Model graphs are implemented as objects of category `TGCellModelGraph` with
#! the following components:
#! - <Ref Oper='GetTGCell' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   the associated `TGCell` object (see <Ref Sect='Section_TGCell'/>)
#! - <Ref Oper='CellCenter' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   the cell center of the model graph
#! - <Ref Oper='ModelType' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   identifier of the type of model, e.g., tessellation, kagome etc.
#! - <Ref Oper='CellVertices' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   the vertices of the model graph, i.e., the sites of the tight-binding model
#! - <Ref Oper='CellEdges' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   the edges of the model graph, i.e., the hoppings of the tight-binding model,
#!   including potential translations associated with them
#! - <Ref Oper='CellFaces' Label='for TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   the oriented faces of the model graph, i.e., the plaquettes of the tight-binding
#!   model
#! and is printed in the form
#! @BeginLog
#! TGCellModelGraph( cell,
#!   center = w,
#!   type = <type>,
#!   vertices = [ [ w1, gi1 ], [ w2, gi2 ], ... ],
#!   edges = [ [ v1, v2, tag, gam ], ... ],
#!   faces = [ [ [ e1, o1 ], [ e2, o2 ], ... ], ... ],
#!   boundary = [ [ d1, d2, e, b, m, gam ], ... ]
#! )

#! @Section Constructing Models
#! @SectionLabel ConstructingModels
#! 
#! There are several functions for constructing specfic tight-binding models:
#! - <Ref Func='TGCellModelGraph'/>:
#!   constructs a model graph from a cell graph and a specification of which cell-graph
#!   vertices are to be used as vertices of the model graph, which define edges,
#!   and which define faces of the model graph.
#! - <Ref Func='TessellationModelGraph'/>:
#!   constructs a tessellation graph from a cell graph of a triangle group.
#! - <Ref Func='KagomeModelGraph'/>:
#!   constructs a kagome graph from a cell graph of a triangle group.

#! In all of those functions, the option `simplify`, which takes a non-negative
#! integer as argument, can be used to specify the level of simplification of words
#! in the translation group, both for the translation generators expressed in terms
#! of generators of the proper triangle group and for the translations expressed
#! as elements of the finitely presented group. The additional option
#! `simplifyMethod`, which takes a string, can be used to specify the method of simplification. 
#! By default `simplifyMethod` is set to `"BruteForce"`. If the package kbmag 
#! (see kbmag reference manual <URL Text="kbmag Reference Manual ">https://docs.gap-system.org/pkg/kbmag/doc/chap0_mj.html</URL>)
#! is loaded it is possible to set `simplifyMethod` to `"KnuthBendix"`, such that the 
#! Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm is used in the simplification. This method uses the available space in cache, 
#! which can be flushed by calling `FlushCaches` 
#! (see section Mutability and Copying in the <URL Text="GAP Reference Manual ">https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap0_mj.html</URL>). 

#! As shown in <Ref Sect='Section_TGCellModelGraph'/>, additional information about the
#! edges is given by edge tags. The edge tags depend on the particular model type, but
#! follow the basic structure
#!   @BeginLog
#! [ n, root ]
#!   @EndLog
#! where `n` specifies the range of the edge, i.e., `1` for nearest-neighbors (based on
#! the cell graph), `2` for next-nearest-neighbors, and so on, and `root` specifies how
#! the edge was constructed.
#! For `n=1`, `root` takes the form
#!   @BeginLog
#! [ [ w, gi ], s1, s2 ]
#!   @EndLog
#! where `gi` is the position of the element $\delta$ in $T_{G^+}(G_w^+)$ characterizing the
#! cell-graph edge vertex the edge roots in, and `s1`, `s2` are the positions of the
#! Schwarz triangles $g_1,g_2$ associated with the cell-graph edges in $T_{\Delta^+}(\Gamma)$.
#! We can obtain $\delta$ as follows:
#!   @BeginLog
#! GetRightTransversal( TGCellMSWPs( GetTGCell( model ) ) )[w][gi]
#!   @EndLog
#! and $g_1$:
#!   @BeginLog
#! GetRightTransversal( TGCellPointGroup( GetTGCell( model ) ) )[s1]
#!   @EndLog
#! For `n=2`, on the other hand, edges are constructed based on faces, and as such `root`
#!   takes the form
#!   @BeginLog
#! [ f, e1, e2 ]
#!   @EndLog
#! where `f` is the position of the face characterizing the edge in the list of faces
#! `CellFaces(model)`, and `e1`, `e2` are the positions of the nearest-neighbor
#! edges that together connect the same vertices as the next-nearest-neighbor edge
#! in the list of edges `CellEdges(model)`.

#!   orientation of the faces of the $\{p,q\}$-tessellation.
#!   Faces with four or less edges are ignored.

#!   The edge tags of the next-nearest neighbor edges take the form
#!   @BeginLog
#! [ 2, [ f, e1, e2 ] ]
#!   @EndLog
#!   where the first entry, `2`, indicates a next-nearest-neighbor edge, `f` is the
